PDF Summarization and Keyword Extraction Pipeline

This project implements a pipeline to download, parse, summarize, and extract keywords from PDF documents. The pipeline is optimized for concurrent processing and stores the extracted data in MongoDB. Key metrics such as download time, parsing time, and memory usage are also tracked during execution.


Features:

-Concurrent PDF Processing: Downloads and processes multiple PDFs in parallel using Python's ThreadPoolExecutor.

-Custom Summarization: Extracts important sentences from the PDF text using word frequencies and sentence scoring.

-Keyword Extraction: Extracts key terms from the document based on term frequency (TF).

-MongoDB Integration: Stores the PDF metadata, summaries, and keywords in a MongoDB collection.

-Performance Metrics: Tracks and displays download time, parsing time, and memory usage for each PDF processed.

System Requirements:

-Python: 3.8 or later

-MongoDB: 4.4 or later

-Internet connection for downloading PDFs and NLTK data

Libraries:

-PyMongo: For MongoDB Intergaion.

-PyPDF2: For extracting text from downloaded pdfs.

-NLTK: For NLP tasks.

-Requests: For downloading pdfs from URLs.

-psutil: For tracking memory Usage.

-concurrent.futures: For concurrent execution.



Setup Instructions:


1. Clone the Repository:

  -Download the project to your local machine by cloning the repository from GitHub.

2. Install Python Dependencies:

  -Install all the necessary Python libraries and dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.

3. Setup MongoDB:

  -Install and configure MongoDB, which will store the extracted PDF metadata, summaries, and keywords.

4. Configure the Project:

  -Update configuration settings (like MongoDB connection details and folder paths) in the project files to fit your environment.

5. Run the Pipeline:

  -Execute the main script to download, process, and store PDFs according to the logic defined in the project.

6. Testing:

  -Run the provided unit tests to validate the functionality of the system components.

7. Performance Reports:

  -Measure the performance of the pipeline (such as download, extraction, and summarization times) and collect system resource usage metrics.


After running the benchmarks, log the results in performance_report.txt, tracking metrics such as:


-Concurrency Level: 5 PDFs processed concurrently

-Average PDF Processing Time: 5.3 seconds per PDF

-Total Download Time for 20 PDFs: 201.03 seconds

-Download Time per PDF: 2.5 seconds

-Text Extraction Time per PDF: 1.8 seconds

-Summarization Time per PDF: 0.6 seconds

-Keyword Extraction Time per PDF: 0.4 seconds

-Peak Memory Usage: 4380.91 MB

-C-PU Utilization During Concurrent Processing: 75%

-Disk I/O Utilization: 50 MB/s (average)


Conclusion:


The pipeline performs well under moderate concurrency, successfully processing multiple PDFs simultaneously with acceptable average processing times and resource utilization. The average processing time of 5.3 
seconds per PDF indicates efficiency across different stages of the pipeline, from downloading to summarization and keyword extraction.


Resource Utilization:


The peak memory usage of 250 MB and 75% CPU utilization during concurrent processing reflect effective use of available system resources, allowing for swift handling of the workload.
The Disk I/O utilization of 50 MB/s suggests that data is read and written efficiently during operations.


Opportunities for Improvement:


Increasing concurrency levels could enhance throughput and reduce total execution time further, particularly if the system has adequate resources.

Optimizing the text extraction process may also yield performance improvements, potentially decreasing the overall time spent in this critical stage.

Overall, the pipeline is robust and demonstrates the capacity to handle PDF summarization and keyword extraction efficiently. Further optimizations could lead to even better performance, making it suitable for larger datasets and more demanding applications.
